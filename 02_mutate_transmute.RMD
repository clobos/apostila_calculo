df <- mutate(df,
             `avg miles per gallon` = (cty + hwy) / 2)
df#YO
#   Create variable "car" & "cyl / trans"
df <- mutate(df,
             car = paste(manufacturer, model, sep = " "),
             `cyl / trans` = paste(cyl, " cylinders", " / ", trans, " transmission", sep = ""))
df#YO
```

## transmute() 

Create new variable and drop other variables

```{r}
